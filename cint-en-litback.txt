Copying is not theft!

He who copies is not a Thief
If someone steals that isn't nice
copying makes lots from little
that ist the copying game.

He who copies is not a Thief
If I copy from you you still have yours
for you yours and for me mine
in the end theres one for everyone

if I steal your bike
i force you in the bus
but if I copy it
then it's practically a must!

to proliferate good things
that is what we call copying
many ideas are valuable
that's why copying's
very great
